<summary><strong>Mini-NeZha: A Wheeled Bipedal Robot with Momentum Wheel</strong></summary>
10/2020 - 06/2021<br>
<a href="https://www.wzhanglab.site/" target="_blank">Control & Learning for Robotics and Autonomy(CLEAR) Lab</a>
<ul>
<li>Participated in the mechanical design of the robot.</li>
<li>Implemented the electric control system of the robot (motor selection and control, high-speed CAN bus communication, etc.) based on STM32 MCU and UpBoard with Linux.</li>
<li>Constructed the multithreaded <a href="https://github.com/Nokkxz/Mini-Nezha" target="_blank">code framework</a> based on C++ object-oriented programming and finite state machine.</li>
<li>Built a simplified simulation model of the robot in Simulink, designed a <a href="https://github.com/Nokkxz/Mini-Nezha-Control" target="_blank">model-based LQR controller</a> and realized trajectory, speed, tilt, squat, and jump control of the robot.</li>
<li>Received the “Special Funds for the Cultivation of Guangdong College Students’ Scientific and Technological Innovation”</li>
